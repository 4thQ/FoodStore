# Food Store

## Nirajan Gurung
The webpage for the Wholesale Food Store serves as an interface for managing and viewing food products stored in the system's database. 
Upon accessing the webpage, users are presented with a list of food products available, displayed in a structured HTML table format. 
Each product entry includes details such as the stock keeping unit (SKU), description, category, and price. This presentation allows users to quickly scan through the available products and their respective information.

In addition to simply listing products, the webpage also provides functionality for interacting with the product database. 
Users can perform actions such as adding new products, editing existing ones, and deleting products as needed. These actions are facilitated through intuitive controls and forms integrated into the webpage interface. 
For instance, clicking on an "Edit" button next to a product allows the user to modify its details directly within the webpage, updating the database accordingly upon submission.

Furthermore, to enhance security, the webpage implements a basic authentication system utilizing the "users" table in the database. 
Administrators are required to log in using their credentials before gaining access to the editing functionalities. 
This ensures that only authorized personnel can make changes to the database contents, providing a layer of protection against unauthorized modifications. 
Overall, the webpage serves as a user-friendly platform for managing the wholesale food inventory, offering both convenience and security to its users.
